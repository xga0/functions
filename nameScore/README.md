# nameScore
Using R to calculate a number based on your initial. For example, my name is Xiangyu Gao, so my initial is “xg”. The location of “x” in the letters is 24 and the location of “g” in the letters is 7. Then my number is 247, which is equal to 24 × 10 + 7. 

This can be used for University instructors to create personlized question/assignment for students. If you encounter the same initials, you can further combine with the student ID.
