# countFrequency
An interesting way to generate a frequency table in dataframe from a list. Inspired by this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-most-undervalued-standard-python-library-14021632f692.

If you want to implement this on a column of a dataframe, you just need to use .tolist() to convert target column to list first.
